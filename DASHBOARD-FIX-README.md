# Dashboard Authentication Fix 🔧

## Problem Solved ✅
The dashboards were redirecting to login page because `requireAuth()` was checking authentication **before** the async initialization completed.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Fixed Session Manager Timing** (`session.js`)
- Made `requireAuth()` async and added `await` for initialization
- Added `initPromise` to track initialization state
- Added detailed console logging for debugging

### 2. **Updated All Dashboards**
- `customer-dashboard.html` ✅
- `seller-dashboard.html` ✅  
- `admin-dashboard.html` ✅
- `dashboard.html` ✅

Changed from:
```javascript
if (!sessionManager.requireAuth()) {
  return;
}
```

To:
```javascript
const isAuthenticated = await sessionManager.requireAuth();
if (!isAuthenticated) {
  return;
}
```

## How to Test 🧪

### Step 1: Start the Server
```bash
cd server
npm start
```

You should see:
```
🚀 Server running on port 3000
📡 API available at http://localhost:3000/api
✅ Connected to MongoDB
📍 Database: ghar.qbuckf8.mongodb.net/
```

### Step 2: Start Frontend
```bash
# In the root directory
npm run dev
```

Or serve static files with any HTTP server.

### Step 3: Test the Flow

#### Register a New User
1. Open `login.html` in your browser
2. Click "Sign Up" or register section
3. Fill in:
   - **Email**: test@example.com
   - **Password**: password123
   - **Full Name**: Test User
   - **User Type**: Select customer, seller, or admin
4. Submit the form

#### Login
1. Use the credentials you just created
2. After successful login, you should be redirected to the appropriate dashboard

#### Check Console Logs
Open browser DevTools (F12) and look for these messages:

**On Dashboard Load:**
```
🔐 SessionManager: Initializing...
🔑 Token found, checking authentication...
🔍 Checking authentication with server...
✅ Authentication successful: test@example.com (customer)
✅ SessionManager initialized. Authenticated: true
🔒 Checking authentication requirement...
✅ User authenticated, continuing...
```

**If Not Authenticated:**
```
🔐 SessionManager: Initializing...
⚠️ No token found, user not authenticated
✅ SessionManager initialized. Authenticated: false
🔒 Checking authentication requirement...
⛔ User not authenticated, redirecting to login...
```

### Step 4: Test Role-Based Routing

After logging in:
- **Customer** → `customer-dashboard.html`
- **Seller** → `seller-dashboard.html`
- **Admin** → `admin-dashboard.html`

Try accessing a different role's dashboard - it should redirect to your appropriate dashboard.

## Troubleshooting 🔍

### Dashboard Still Redirects to Login

**1. Check if server is running:**
```bash
# Should show server running
curl http://localhost:3000/api/user/profile
```

**2. Check browser console:**
- Look for error messages in red
- Check the authentication flow logs

**3. Check localStorage:**
In browser DevTools Console:
```javascript
localStorage.getItem('token')
```
Should show a JWT token if logged in.

**4. Clear localStorage and try again:**
```javascript
localStorage.clear()
```
Then register/login again.

### Server Connection Issues

**Error: "Auth check error"**
- Ensure server is running on port 3000
- Check CORS is enabled in server
- Verify MongoDB connection is successful

**Error: "Invalid token"**
- Token might be expired (24h validity)
- Clear localStorage and login again

### Database Issues

**Error: "User not found"**
- User might not exist in database
- Register a new user
- Check MongoDB connection

## Security Notes 🔒

1. **Environment Variables**: Created `.env` file for sensitive data
2. **JWT Secret**: Change `JWT_SECRET` in `.env` for production
3. **Token Expiry**: Tokens expire after 24 hours
4. **Password Hashing**: Using bcrypt for secure password storage

## Dashboard Features by Role 📊

### Customer Dashboard
- View orders
- Manage wishlist
- Track orders
- Profile management

### Seller Dashboard
- Add/edit products
- Manage inventory
- View sales analytics
- Upload 3D models for AR

### Admin Dashboard
- User management
- System analytics
- Platform health monitoring
- Admin actions (reports, backups, logs)

## Next Steps 🚀

1. **Test all three user types**
2. **Verify role-based routing works**
3. **Check that protected routes require authentication**
4. **Test logout functionality**
5. **Ensure session persists on page refresh**
