# 🤖 HomeGo AI Chatbot - Role-Based Integration

> **AI-powered chatbot with intelligent role-based access control**

## 🎉 Integration Complete!

Your HomeGo platform now has a **fully functional AI chatbot** integrated with **role-based access control**. The chatbot appears only for authorized user types on specific pages.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. **Test the Chatbot**
Open any of these pages to see the chatbot in action:

| Page | User Type Required | What to See |
|------|-------------------|-------------|
| `index.html` | Customer (anyone) | 🟢 Chatbot button in bottom-right |
| `seller.html` | Seller | 🟢 Chatbot with seller features |
| `admin.html` | Admin | 🟢 Chatbot with admin tools |
| `customer-support.html` | Customer/Support | 🟢 Chatbot for support help |

### 2. **Check Browser Console**
Look for this message when the chatbot loads:
```
Chatbot initialized for role: customer
```

Or if unauthorized:
```
Chatbot not available for current user role
```

## 🔧 How It Works

### Simple Authorization Flow:
```
1. User opens a page (e.g., seller.html)
2. Chatbot checks localStorage for 'userSession'
3. Extracts user role from session
4. Compares to allowed roles for that page
5. If authorized → Show chatbot ✅
6. If not authorized → Hide chatbot ❌
```

### Session Format:
```json
{
  "userId": "user123",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "role": "customer"
}
```

## 📊 Access Matrix

| Page | Customer | Seller | Admin | Support |
|------|----------|--------|-------|---------|
| index.html | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| seller.html | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| admin.html | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| customer-support.html | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

## 🔒 Security Notes

### Current Implementation:

- ✅ Session-based authorization
- ✅ Graceful unauthorized access handling

### Production Recommendations:
- 🔐 Move API key to backend (currently client-side)
- 🔐 Add backend role validation for API calls
- 🔐 Use HTTPS for all connections
- 🔐 Implement JWT tokens
- 🔐 Add rate limiting

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Chatbot Not Appearing?
1. **Check console for errors**
   - Press F12 → Console tab
   - Look for error messages

2. **Verify session in localStorage**
   - Press F12 → Application tab → Local Storage
   - Check if `userSession` exists
   - Verify role matches page requirements

3. **Check backend status**
   - Ensure MongoDB server is running
   - Backend should be at `http://localhost:3000`

4. **Clear cache**
   - Ctrl+Shift+Delete
   - Clear cache and cookies
   - Reload page

### Wrong Chatbot Experience?
- Logout and login again with correct role
- Check `userSession.role` in localStorage
